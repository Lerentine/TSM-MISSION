  <tsm.a1>Hello, I am the captain of Peregrine Falcon Squad, The Sea of Miracles. We're overwhelmed with tasks and can't handle everything, so we're hoping for some assistance with certain matters, and of course, we'll pay for it!</tsm.a1>
  <tsm.a2>The situation in The Sea of Miracles is not great. We were about to head to Kyushu Armory, but then commissions came up here. What's your opinion about finishing them for us? </tsm.a2>
  <tsm.a3>Hello, I am the liaison officer from EMBI. We have posted a few commissions; are you interested in any of them?</tsm.a3>
  <tsm.a4>Europa is vast, we love it in its immensity; time is long, we love it in its brevity; our lives are eager and fiery, deserving of living slowly, and also deserving of sudden death. This is a world where departure is common, but sadly, we're not good at goodbyes. Thus, before setting sail, the most important thing is to first be brave, then honest, and finally, believe in the existence of miracles! And, never forget each other...</tsm.a4>
  <tsm.a4>I still have precious memories of Earth in my mind. The azure sky with gleaming stars, how beautiful the world was...</tsm.a4>
  <tsm.a4>What is more important than wealth and glory in Europa is trust. Sailor, can I trust you?</tsm.a4>
  <tsm.a4>Hi sailor, have you seen captain Eagle recently? No, I'm just asking. I think I left a toy duck in his locker before I realized it was stuffed with UEX...</tsm.a4>
  <tsm.a4>Human beings are distinguished from animals because they have not only animal instincts but also free will and absolute spirituality. Do you want to live like a human or an animal, sailor?</tsm.a4>
  <tsm.a5>What? You say you want to buy some slaves for your ship? Sorry, this is no longer a slave market. Slavery has been banned, so now we call it a talent market.</tsm.a5>
  <tsm.a5>The 'summer' I spent with them was cruel indeed, so many people I'll never see again...</tsm.a5>
  <tsm.a5>What paranormal event? Don't give me that nonsense about ghosts and goblins; the engine's tail flame can melt all ignorance and superstition.</tsm.a5>
  <tsm.a5>We are now walking the path our predecessors have trodden. For them in another dimension, these are history, but for us, they are experiences.</tsm.a5>
  <tsm.a6>Don't negate all the meetings and companionships just because everything ends in death and departure.</tsm.a6>
  <tsm.a7>Hello I Kuiteman<!-- [sic] -->, I've sent the recent commissions to your terminal, thanks for your cooperation.</tsm.a7>
  <tsm.a71>I guess you are kuiteman pig!</tsm.a71>
  <tsm.a72>O.o</tsm.a72>
  <tsm.a8>Hey, dude, welcome to our outpost. We've been having some trouble lately, can I ask you a favor?</tsm.a8>
  <tsm.a81>Though he wears a clown mask, his flamboyant attire allows you to instantly recognize him as a bishop wanted by both the Coalition and TSM. Looking around, you decided to listen to what kind of favor he's going to ask.</tsm.a81> <!-- todo -->
  <tsm.a82>I was heading to the next outpost, but the channel is blocked by The Sea of Miracles right now. I have something very important to do there, if... I mean, if you could help deal with them...</tsm.a82>
  <tsm.a83>It would depend on how sincere you'd like to be.</tsm.a83>
  <tsm.a84>Oh! My friend, I can be as sincere as you want me to be.</tsm.a84>
  <tsm.a8a>You recognize him as a wanted man and handcuff him.</tsm.a8a>
  <tsm.a8b>"You asshole, do you know where you are! This is not the territory of your The Seditionists of Mendacity! Somebody, somebody!" The bishop yells over, and everyone around you leans toward you with all kinds of weapons.</tsm.a8b> <!-- This is the best I could come up with - The Seditionists of Mendacity - I wonder if there are better ones -->
  <tsm.a8c>You have a bad feeling and are about to flee when an explosion goes off and the Coalition Riot Suppression Force invades from all over the place.</tsm.a8c>
  <tsm.a8d>While you're still in a daze, you hear from a walkie-talkie, "Empty the room, leave no one alive!"</tsm.a8d>
  <tsm.b8>Ignore him and leave.</tsm.b8>

  <tsm.next>Welcome to the next one.</tsm.next>
  <tsm.next1>Sorry about that, the price is still a bit high for you, come back next time.</tsm.next1>
  <tsm.next2>You don't have enough money, should you take on some tasks to earn money?</tsm.next2>
