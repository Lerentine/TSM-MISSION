  <tsm.a1>Hello, I am the captain of Peregrine Falcon Squad, TerraSynergy Matrix. We're overwhelmed with tasks and can't handle everything, so we're hoping for some assistance with certain matters, and of course, we'll pay for it!</tsm.a1>
  <tsm.a2>The situation in TerraSynergy Matrix is not great. We were about to head to Kyushu Armory, but then commissions came up here. What's your opinion about finishing them for us? </tsm.a2>
  <tsm.a3>Hello, I am the liaison officer from EMBI. We have posted a few commissions; are you interested in any of them?</tsm.a3>
  <tsm.a4>Europa is vast, we love it in its immensity; time is long, we love it in its brevity; our lives are eager and fiery, deserving of living slowly, and also deserving of sudden death. This is a world where departure is common, but sadly, we're not good at goodbyes. Thus, before setting sail, the most important thing is to first be brave, then honest, and finally, believe in the existence of miracles! And, never forget each other...</tsm.a4>
  <tsm.a4>I still have precious memories of Earth in my mind. The azure sky with gleaming stars, how beautiful the world was...</tsm.a4>
  <tsm.a4>What is more important than wealth and glory in Europa is trust. Sailor, can I trust you?</tsm.a4>
  <tsm.a4>Hi sailor, have you seen captain Eagle recently? No, I'm just asking. I think I left a toy duck in his locker before I realized it was stuffed with UEX...</tsm.a4>
  <tsm.a4>Human beings are distinguished from animals because they have not only animal instincts but also free will and absolute spirituality. Do you want to live like a human or an animal, sailor?</tsm.a4>
  <tsm.a5>What? You say you want to buy some slaves for your ship? Sorry, this is no longer a slave market. Slavery has been banned, so now we call it a talent market.</tsm.a5>
  <tsm.a5>The 'summer' I spent with them was cruel indeed, so many people I'll never see again...</tsm.a5>
  <tsm.a5>What paranormal event? Don't give me that nonsense about ghosts and goblins; the engine's tail flame can melt all ignorance and superstition.</tsm.a5>
  <tsm.a5>We are now walking the path our predecessors have trodden. For them in another dimension, these are history, but for us, they are experiences.</tsm.a5>
  <tsm.a6>Don't negate all the meetings and companionships just because everything ends in death and departure.</tsm.a6>
  <tsm.a7>Hello I Kuiteman, I've sent the recent commissions to your terminal, thanks for your cooperation.</tsm.a7>
  <tsm.a71>I guess you are kuiteman pig!</tsm.a71>
  <tsm.a72>O.o</tsm.a72>
  <tsm.a8>Hey, dude, welcome to our outpost. We've been having some trouble lately, can I ask you a favor?</tsm.a8>
  <tsm.a81>Though he wears a clown mask, his flamboyant attire allows you to instantly recognize him as a bishop wanted by both the Coalition and TSM. Looking around, you decided to listen to what kind of favor he's going to ask.</tsm.a81>
  <tsm.a82>I was heading to the next outpost, but the channel is blocked by TerraSynergy Matrix right now. I have something very important to do there, if... I mean, if you could help deal with them...</tsm.a82>
  <tsm.a83>It would depend on how sincere you'd like to be.</tsm.a83>
  <tsm.a84>Oh! My friend, I can be as sincere as you want me to be.</tsm.a84>
  <tsm.a8a>You recognize him as a wanted man and handcuff him.</tsm.a8a>
  <tsm.a8b>"You asshole, do you know where you are! This is not the territory of your The Seditionists of Mendacity! Somebody, somebody!" The bishop yells over, and everyone around you leans toward you with all kinds of weapons.</tsm.a8b>
  <tsm.a8c>You have a bad feeling and are about to flee when an explosion goes off and the Coalition Riot Suppression Force invades from all over the place.</tsm.a8c>
  <tsm.a8d>While you're still in a daze, you hear from a walkie-talkie, "Empty the room, leave no one alive!"</tsm.a8d>
  <tsm.b8>Ignore him and leave.</tsm.b8>

  <eventtext.unlockpathcoldcaverns.tsmc1>“You want to pass this checkpoint?”\nThe administrator looked up, his gaze sweeping through the fleet via the control panel's light screen, then skillfully operating the terminal,\n“Wait a moment, I need to verify your fleet's records.”\nA few seconds later\n“Welcome, Captain. After review, your reputation is sufficient. Permission to travel to the Europan Ridge has been granted. The authorization has been synced to your terminal.”\nHe paused, a hint of seriousness flashing in his eyes\n“But, the Europan Ridge is far more perilous than previous routes. Deep-sea currents, unknown creatures, and wrecked ships may threaten your safety at any moment. Captain, please stay calm and cautious.”</eventtext.unlockpathcoldcaverns.tsmc1>
  <eventtext.unlockpathcoldcaverns.tsmc2>“You want to dive into deeper waters?”\nThe administrator smiled faintly, lightly touching the terminal, “Hold on a moment, I need to pull up your records.”\nA few seconds later, the data on the screen made the administrator frown, “Sorry, according to the current records, you haven't met the requirements to pass the blockade.”\n“But...” he paused, glancing from the terminal to you, with a slightly playful tone, “This is TerraSynergy Matrix, after all. In these waters, there are always exceptions. If you insist on heading deeper, we can make an exception—provided you pay a 2000mk deposit.”\nThe administrator leaned back in his chair, his gaze filled with a mix of anticipation and calculation, “Now, the decision is yours. What will you choose?”</eventtext.unlockpathcoldcaverns.tsmc2>
  <eventtext.unlockpathcoldcaverns.tsmo1>2000MK, deal!</eventtext.unlockpathcoldcaverns.tsmo1>
  <eventtext.unlockpathcoldcaverns.tsmo1.tsmc1>“Great! I like people with this kind of attitude. I'll let the folks at the blockade know; you just go ahead.”</eventtext.unlockpathcoldcaverns.tsmo1.tsmc1>
  <eventtext.unlockpathcoldcaverns.tsmo1.nomoney>“No money? Well, then I can't help you. Your fleet's records don't look too promising. If you're broke, consider earning some cash through bounties.”</eventtext.unlockpathcoldcaverns.tsmo1.nomoney>

  <eventtext.unlockpatheuropanridge.tsmc1>“You want to head to the Aphotic Plateau?”\n“Please hold on a second,” the administrator's fingers swiftly glided over the terminal.\nA moment later, the administrator smiled in satisfaction, “It seems you've been contributing a lot to the Ice Ridge. I'm pleased to announce—you now have access to the Aphotic Plateau.”\n“May you sail smoothly in those dark depths. Safe travels, Captain.”</eventtext.unlockpatheuropanridge.tsmc1>
  <eventtext.unlockpatheuropanridge.tsmc2>“You want to enter the Aphotic Plateau?”\nThe administrator squinted, lightly tapping the terminal, and chuckled softly after a moment, “Judging by the records, this doesn't look too promising…”</eventtext.unlockpatheuropanridge.tsmc2>
  <eventtext.unlockpatheuropanridge.tsmo1>“I understand, I understand, is 4500mk enough?”</eventtext.unlockpatheuropanridge.tsmo1>
  <eventtext.unlockpatheuropanridge.tsmo1.tsmc1>“Your records aren't bad, but are you truly ready? This dangerous sea won't accept just anyone.”</eventtext.unlockpatheuropanridge.tsmo1.tsmc1>
  <eventtext.unlockpatheuropanridge.tsmo1.nomoney>“Not enough money, huh? Well, we've recently posted some bounty missions, why not give them a shot?”</eventtext.unlockpatheuropanridge.tsmo1.nomoney>
  <eventtext.unlockpatheuropanridge.tsmo2.tsmc1>“Whether you go or not, that's not for us to decide, it's up to you. After all, the Europa Ridge is a great place to live, isn't it?”</eventtext.unlockpatheuropanridge.tsmo2.tsmc1>
  <eventtext.unlockpathaphoticplateau.tsmc1>“Ah, it's you! You're the star fleet everyone's been talking about, right? Your tales are all over Europa.”\n“Of course, of course, this means you've earned the right to traverse the Aphotic Plateau. You may now set sail for the Great Sea. Not many fleets have managed to make it there under the current circumstances.”\nThe administrator stood up and shook your hand, “I'll notify the checkpoint ahead to allow your passage into the Abyss. May you proceed safely through those unfathomable waters.”</eventtext.unlockpathaphoticplateau.tsmc1>
  <eventtext.unlockpathaphoticplateau.tsmc2>“My apologies,”\nThe administrator sighed, a hint of helplessness in his expression, “I know it hasn't been easy for you to make it this far, you've overcome many obstacles. But we cannot risk letting an unqualified fleet venture into the Great Sea.”\nHe looked up, his tone softening slightly, “This is for your protection. I hope you understand, not everyone can handle the dangers lurking there.”</eventtext.unlockpathaphoticplateau.tsmc2>
  <eventtext.unlockpathaphoticplateau.tsmo1>“What if we pay a 9K deposit?”</eventtext.unlockpathaphoticplateau.tsmo1>
  <eventtext.unlockpathaphoticplateau.tsmo1.tsmc1>“According to our regulations, you can indeed pass,” he said slowly, his tone solemn.\n“But I must advise you to think carefully. The Great Sea is not a place to tread lightly.” He gazed at you, his voice low and full of meaning.\n“That sea holds endless unknowns and dangers, and not everyone returns from it. Please consider carefully.”</eventtext.unlockpathaphoticplateau.tsmo1.tsmc1>
  <eventtext.unlockpathaphoticplateau.tsmo1.nomoney>“If you don't have enough money, don't push it. Besides, money isn't everything—stay alive first, then talk.”</eventtext.unlockpathaphoticplateau.tsmo1.nomoney>
  <eventtext.unlockpathaphoticplateau.tsmo2.tsmc1>“As I said, there's no need to go overboard. The Aphotic Plateau are great, livable, and Sea of Miracles's headquarters are there. Why not buy an apartment and retire?”</eventtext.unlockpathaphoticplateau.tsmo2.tsmc1>
  <eventtext.unlockpathgreatsea.tsmc1>The administrator saw you from afar and stood up, shaking your hand. “Look who it is! The famous star fleet! What can I do for you this time?”\nUpon hearing your request to travel to the Hydrothermal Wastes, the administrator's expression stiffened slightly. He was silent for a moment, then spoke in a slow, deliberate tone: “The number of creatures in the next area is abnormally high, and the currents stirred by geothermal activity will make navigation even more dangerous.” He looked at you, as if gauging your resolve. “Are you truly prepared?”\nHe straightened up and saluted you. “Then, please be careful—do not be careless.”</eventtext.unlockpathgreatsea.tsmc1>
  <eventtext.unlockpathgreatsea.tsmc2>“So you want to enter the Hydrothermal Wasteland? Many fleets have tried, and many have gone missing. This is TerraSynergy Matrix's deposit system. If you're determined to go, take a look.”</eventtext.unlockpathgreatsea.tsmc2>
  <eventtext.unlockpathgreatsea.tsmo1>“17000mk? No problem, I'll transfer the money shortly.”</eventtext.unlockpathgreatsea.tsmo1>
  <eventtext.unlockpathgreatsea.tsmo1.tsmc1>“Don't rush. You can always reconsider. It's rare to see someone who's both earning money with their life and buying their way into danger. First time I've seen someone paying to die.”</eventtext.unlockpathgreatsea.tsmo1.tsmc1>
  <eventtext.unlockpathgreatsea.tsmo1.nomoney>“Then don't go. You need both money and life to enjoy it. As long as you're alive, you'll always have money.”</eventtext.unlockpathgreatsea.tsmo1.nomoney>
  <eventtext.unlockpathgreatsea.tsmo2.tsmc1>“Many could've stood where you are now, with the courage to press forward.”</eventtext.unlockpathgreatsea.tsmo2.tsmc1>

  <tsm_lin_t1>An anxious looking engineer stopped you./nHey！Was the submarine that just docked yours?？</tsm_lin_t1>
  <tsm_lin_t2>I detected that T034 is active in the nearby waters. By coincidence, my submarine is under maintenance and can't move. Could you possibly help me out...</tsm_lin_t2>
  <tsm_lin_t4>Please let me explain... After the 034 experimental accident, T037 has regained its sanity and is still in a weakened state. It still has some kind of device left by Dr. Lin Han on its body. If we can investigate it further, I think humanity will soon be able to conquer it... I know sailors don't like these empty promises, but I've already prepared the reward, and I'll provide you with insulating diving suits. Plzzzz.</tsm_lin_t4>
  <tsm_lin_t5>That's right... He devoted his entire life to T037, tormenting himself in the process, and in the end, he was destroyed by it—both in life and in reputation. I just want to finish the journey he never completed.</tsm_lin_t5>
  <tsm_lin_t6>I will send the insulating tech diving suits to the submarine's cargo hold before you set off. Remember to throw some flares or other luminous objects to distract it. Although it is in a weakened state now, do not let your guard down. Defeat T034, remove the suspicious device from it, and I will be waiting for your good news at the next station. I salute you.</tsm_lin_t6>
  <tsm_lin_p1>Yes,what?</tsm_lin_p1>
  <tsm_lin_p2>You mean T037?! No way, that thing almost wiped out all of humanity on Europa before. There's no way we're going to commit suicide for you!</tsm_lin_p2>
  <tsm_lin_p3>Dr. Lin Han? Let me guess, you're his daughter, Lin Heyin?</tsm_lin_p3>
  <tsm_lin_p4>Alright... You scientists, though always making mistakes, are the ones we have to rely on to lead human civilization forward. What should I do?</tsm_lin_p4>
  <tsm_lin_t11>Congratulations! Did you manage to retrieve the suspicious device from T034?</tsm_lin_t11>
  <tsm_lin_t12>It's a pity... But as long as you're safe, that's what matters. Well done, everyone.</tsm_lin_t12>
  <tsm_lin_t13>He was just trying to communicate with T034 using a brain - computer interface, but an accident happened... Now there's an incredible hypothesis: Dr. Lin Han might still be alive. He accidentally uploaded part of his consciousness into T034's brain, but it's extremely unstable... How could a human possibly adapt to a giant beast's body? So both he and T034 are in great pain now.</tsm_lin_t13>
  <tsm_lin_t14>This is just a hypothesis I deduced using a theoretical model. If this brain - computer interface port system can still be repaired and the operational logs inside can be retrieved, all the problems will be solved effortlessly... You've done me a great favor, and I can also lend a hand to your submarine. Leave the electrical work to me!</tsm_lin_t14>
  <tsm_lin_t15>This is... the brain - computer interface port system, and it's actually been preserved!</tsm_lin_t15>
  <tsm_lin_p11>It lost consciousness and sank into the abyss, and it was too deep. Our submarine hasn't regained its power yet. I'm sorry we didn't retrieve the device you needed.</tsm_lin_p11>
  <tsm_lin_p12>Brain - computer interface? So the rumors are true? Dr. Lin Han connected his consciousness to T037 using a brain - computer interface, which caused T037 to go berserk and almost made the people of Europa regress to Crawlers.</tsm_lin_p12>
  <tsm_lin_p13>This is madness! You should report this to the Coalition and the TerraSynergy Matrix. If it goes berserk again, many more people will die!</tsm_lin_p13>
  <tsm_lin_p14>I got it!</tsm_lin_p14>
  <tsm_lin_p15>You don't have it with you? Then I'll wait here for you. Please go and get it.</tsm_lin_p15>

  <tsm.tl59>Hello, I am Phantom Lang, the head of TerraSynergy Matrix Armory. I'm here to issue bounties from TerraSynergy Matrix to passing captains.</tsm.tl59>
  <tsm.tl60>You are... Phantom Lang?</tsm.tl60>
  <tsm.tl61>Ah, yes, that's my nickname. You can call me that too.</tsm.tl61>
  <tsm.tl62>No, I mean: I've met someone called "Phantom Lang" before...</tsm.tl62>
  <tsm.tl63>Oh, I know what you mean. Those were my people. They were issuing commands on my behalf, but many of them are now missing...gone without a trace. If you see them, please let me know.</tsm.tl63>
  <tsm.tl64>Oh, I see. Alright, alright. So, what tasks do you have now?</tsm.tl64>
  <tsm.tl65>Hmm... I've already sent the tasks to your panel. Please proceed with caution.\nAnd... try to stay alive.</tsm.tl65>
  <tsm.tl66>This route is now under a blockade by TerraSynergy Matrix. Turn back immediately, or we will resort to forceful expulsion!</tsm.tl66>
  <tsm.tl67>This is your final warning! Turn back now!</tsm.tl67>
  <tsm.tl68>You see a man acting suspiciously, so you approach him to see what he's up to.</tsm.tl68>
  <tsm.tl69>"What are you doing?" you say while putting a hand on his shoulder.</tsm.tl69>
  <tsm.tl70>The man is clearly startled. After glancing at the device in his hand, he stares at you blankly. As soon as you realize what he's holding, he takes off running.</tsm.tl70>
  <tsm.tl71>"Don't run!" Just as you start to chase after him, alarms begin blaring throughout the station.</tsm.tl71>
  <tsm.tl72>T.S.M: \nUnknown hostile forces have been detected, T-71 defense protocol has been activated.\nThe entire station is now under lockdown. All civilians are urged to remain calm and proceed to the nearest safety shelter. The Sunset Operations Department will begin clearing out the intruders. Please refrain from taking any unauthorized actions and wait for the situation to stabilize.</tsm.tl72>
