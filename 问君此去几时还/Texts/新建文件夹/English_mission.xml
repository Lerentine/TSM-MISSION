  <missionmessage0.tsmmission39>"Did you know? Europa's subsurface ocean holds endless unknowns, its ice crust tens of kilometers thick—a final lock guarding the secrets of the deep."
    "Initially, humanity spent decades building a series of deep-sea colonial stations. Through the pioneer probe 'Europa Pioneer,' we drilled through the ice and laid the groundwork for infrastructure. These stations were self-sufficient, connected by a network of subsea tunnels that linked steel islands floating in the abyss."
    "Yet, humanity's transformation of Europa faltered. As colonies expanded, unforeseen issues arose. Stations faced 'ecological anomalies'—native lifeforms, experimental species, or secrets from the abyss began proliferating. These entities, products of rapid evolution, displayed parasitic and predatory traits. Worse, chemical pollutants from probes and mining equipment awakened ancient, unspeakable beings."
    "Then Earth fell silent. Infighting, attacks by deep-sea horrors... The once-hopeful colonization became synonymous with terror. Colonists faced frequent 'abyssal crises': equipment destroyed, submersibles vanishing..."
    "Now, colonization treads cautiously. Stations rely on fragile submarine passages; every dive risks life and death. Europa is no mere frontier—it is a dangerous unknown, a symbol of both hope and humanity's folly. Rumors say its depths hide more: a true alien biosphere, or entities beyond imagination."</missionmessage0.tsmmission39>
